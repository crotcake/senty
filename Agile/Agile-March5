Agile Group Meeting on March 5th
**Michael Gigiolio couldn't make it**

Jonathan Bayer:
Since the last meeting I have researched Twitter APIs and Bot Detection.
By the next meeting I will have a better understanding of these and will know how to proceed.
A roadblock I have encountered is the Twitter API uses JavaScript and I have no experience with this language.

Andrew Grillot:
I have been working on getting Hiroku up and working so we can start testing and integrating other aspects.
By the next meeting I will have Hiroku running so we can begin integration.
I came on with no knowledge about Hiroku, so this has been very challenging.

Juan Peasley:
I have been researching word quality and ways to implement this into our project.
By the next meeting I should have defined knowledge about what needs to be done and potentially a start on implementation.
Determining how to integrate this into our project is proving really challenging.

Maxim Moghadam:
I've been doing preliminary work on the Gantt Chart and updating Trello.
By the next meeting I will have finished creating defined completion dates and goals.
It has been challenging coordinating with the team to organize as much as the Gantt Chart as possible before the meeting.

Stacy Hayes:
I've been working on getting the website for user interface started.
By next meeting I should have a preliminary website completed for fine-tuning and integration.
It has been challenging creating a website that will serve as the front-end without access to any sort of backend.
